# Workshop-Task-1
make ice cream cone
triangle - dimensions form P5.js resource- triangle(30,75,58,20,86,75) - equilateral triangle
circle/ellipse
first try came out upside down
tried a for loop - only one shape was created
went through P5js guide to creating an ice cream cone
tried searching the code to rotate triangle
What is 'POP' and 'Push'? 
- Pop: restores the state of the previous condition
- Push: function that creates a new drawing state
Used code from resource as a guide to creating own code - got a very different outcome - only triangles all across page rotating in different direction 
tried to mirror the code for the shapes I was using
I did not get what I had in mind but something similar and experimented with a very different code while incorporating what we learnt in the workshop
