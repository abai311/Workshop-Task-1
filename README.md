make ice cream cone
triangle - dimensions form P5.js resource- triangle(30,75,58,20,86,75) - equilateral triangle
circle/ellipse
first try came out upside down
tried a for loop - only one shape was created
went through P5js guide to creating an ice cream cone
tried searching the code to rotate triangle
Kept searching for different ways to incorporate functions from workshop, wanted to understand it better, more examples, different codes using the same fundamentals
In P5js came across a resource on rotating triangles
What is 'POP' and 'Push'? 
- Pop: restores the state of the previous condition
- Push: function that creates a new drawing state
Used code from resource as a skeleton for creating own code - got a very different outcome that what I thought I would get - only triangles all across page rotating in different direction 
tried to mirror the code for the shapes I was using
Kept changing around values till I got a reasonable outcome and a code I could understand easily - ended up making more with the same functions but a few differences every now and then. 
I did not get what I had in mind but something similar and experimented with a very different code while incorporating what we learnt in the workshop
